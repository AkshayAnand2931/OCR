# OCR

This repository is for a team project for the university course **Topics in Deep Learning**. The project was to create an application which extract text from whiteboard images and digitize them. YOLO and Tesseract were used as different approaches to generate bounding boxes. TrOCR and Gemini API were used as different approaches to read text in bounding boxes.
